# flower_prediction
In the following program we are going to use CNN (Conventional Neural Network) to solve a classification problem of recognizingthe flower typer-rose, chamomile, dandelion,sunflower and tulip

# Algorithm
1.Importing modules

2.Importing Dataset 

3.Image Data Generator

4.Model Development 

5.Model Evaluation and Prediction

# Modules used
Pandas, Numpu, Matplotlib, Sklearn, OpenCV, Tensorflow 

# improvisation
the results can be improvised by using Transfer learning algorithm. An example of Transfer learning algorithm is Resnet50
